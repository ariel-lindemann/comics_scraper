# Comics Scraper

[![Python 3.9+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

This script scrapes comics from `readallcomics.com` and stores them as PDFs

## Installation

Type the following into your terminal to clone the repository:

`git clone https://github.com/ariel-lindemann/comics_scraper.git`

Then enter the directory

`cd comics_scraper`

Install dependencies:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

And run the program by typing

`python3 -m main.py`

## Usage

The command line interface will guide you through selecting series titles 
and issue numbers which you can add to the download queue. 
You can always return from the selection menu by typing `END`. 
This process can be repeated until all the comics you want to download are 
selected, after which you can start the download. 
Be aware that this may take some time depending on your selection and the 
speed of your connection.

## Development

This is a hobby project and I am developing it in my spare time. As the main features are already implemented, updates will consist of minor enhancements.
